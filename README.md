# Password-Manager

The code you provided is written in Python and implements a simple account management system. Here's a breakdown of what each part does:

Imports:

hashlib: This library provides functions for various cryptographic operations, including hashing. Here, it's used to securely store passwords. Hashing is a one-way process that converts a plain text password into a scrambled code (hash) that cannot be easily reversed back into the original password.
getpass: This library is used to hide the user's password as they type it. This is important for security as it prevents anyone looking over the user's shoulder from seeing their password.
Variable:

password_manager: This dictionary is used to store usernames and their corresponding hashed passwords. It acts like a simple database for user accounts.
Functions:

create_account():
  This function allows users to create new accounts.
  It prompts the user to enter a desired username and password.
  getpass.getpass() is used to hide the password input, enhancing security.
  The entered password is converted to bytes using encode() for hashing compatibility.
  The hashlib.sha256() function is used to create a secure hash of the password.
  The username and the generated hash are stored together in the password_manager dictionary.
  Finally, a success message is printed.
  
login():
  This function allows users to log in to existing accounts.
  It prompts the user to enter their username and password.
  Similar to create_account(), getpass.getpass() hides the password input.
  The entered password is hashed the same way it was during account creation, ensuring consistency.
  The function checks if the entered username exists in the password_manager dictionary.
  If the username exists, it further verifies if the hashed password (from login attempt) matches the one stored for that username.
  If both username and password match, a login success message is displayed.
  If there's a mismatch, an "Invalid username or password" message is shown.
  
main():
  This is the main function that controls the program flow.
  It uses a while loop to continuously present the user with a menu offering three choices:
  Create an account
  Login
  Exit (choice 0)
  The user's choice is stored in the choice variable.
  An if/elif statement checks the user's choice and executes the corresponding function:
  Choice 1 calls create_account() to create a new account.
  Choice 2 calls login() for user login attempt.
  Choice 0 breaks out of the loop, effectively exiting the program.
  Any other choice results in an "Invalid choice" message.
  Final line:

if __name__ == "__main__":: 
  This line ensures the main() function only runs when the script is executed directly and not when imported as a module.
  Overall, this code provides basic user account management with functionalities for creating accounts and logging in. It demonstrates a fundamental approach to storing passwords securely using hashing, but it's 
  important to note that for real-world applications, more robust security measures are typically implemented.
